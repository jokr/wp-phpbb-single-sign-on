=== PHPBB Single Sign On ===
Contributors: onigoetz, jokr
Tags: phpbb, authentication, password, login, single sign on, wrapper, connector
Requires at least: 2.8.0
Tested up to: 3.1.1

Authenticate in Wordpress and phpBB at the same time

== Description ==

This plugin allows to use the password from a working phpBB installation to log into a Wordpress blog. or on the other side to log into phpBB with the Wordpress user.

The user needs to exists in at least one of the two instllations. if the user doesn't exist in one installation, it will create the user.

NEW : WP2BB, you can now define that your posts are published in a forum, so that your community can add comments directly on them

The username for the administration must be the same on the two installations.
Otherwise you will end having admins that have no privileges on the other part.

This version tries to get the application working with multiple databases.
Please give me feedbacks.

P.S. : WP2BB was created by Alfredo de Hoces (http://www.alfredodehoces.com/)
